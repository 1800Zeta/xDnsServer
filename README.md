#xActiveDirectory
---------------

The xActiveDirectory module is a part of the Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) Resource Kit, which is a collection of DSC Resources produced by the PowerShell Team. This module contains the xADDomain, xADDomainController, xADUser, xWaitForDomain, and xADDomainTrust resources. These DSC Resources allow you to configure and manage Active Directory.  Note: these resources do not presently install the RSAT tools. 

All of the resources in the DSC Resource Kit are provided AS IS, and are not supported through any Microsoft standard support program or service. The "x" in xActiveDirectory stands for experimental, which means that these resources will be fix forward and monitored by the module owner(s). 

Please leave comments, feature requests, and bug reports in the Q & A tab for this module.

If you would like to modify xActiveDirectory module, feel free. When modifying, please update the module name, resource friendly name, and MOF class name (instructions below). As specified in the license, you may copy or modify this resource as long as they are used on the Windows Platform.
